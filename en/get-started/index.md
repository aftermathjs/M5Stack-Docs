## Get Started

This document is intended to help users set up the software environment(`Arudino`, `MicroPython`) for development of M5Stack. Through a simple example we would like to illustrate how to develop M5Stack boards, firmware(`Arduino`) or source files(`MicroPython`) download to M5Stack boards. 


### Introduction

TODO: add introduction of hardware source on M5Stack Core


### What You Need

To develop applications for M5Stack Core you need:

* **PC** loaded with either Windows, Linux or Mac operating system
* a **M5Stack Core** with Type-C cable
 
Before setting development environment, the three steps you need to follow:

1. Establish **serial** connection
TODO: linked to `Establish **serial** connection`
2. Getting of **ESP-IDF** from GitHub
