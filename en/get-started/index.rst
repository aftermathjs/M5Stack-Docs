This document is intended to help users set up the software environment for development of applications. Through a simple example we would like to illustrate how to develop M5Stack boards, firmware(`Arduino IDE`) or source files(`Micropython`) download to M5Stack boards. 


Introduction
============

(add introduction of hardware source on M5Stack Core)


What You Need
=============

To develop applications for M5Stack Core you need:

* **PC** loaded with either Windows, Linux or Mac operating system
* a **M5Stack Core** with Type-C cable
 
Preparation of development environment consists of three steps:

1. Setup of **Toolchain**
2. Getting of **ESP-IDF** from GitHub

1. Configuration
2. 

See instructions below that will walk you through these steps.


Your boards
============

If you have one of ESP32 development boards listed below, click on provided links to get you up and running.
